# hi there, i'm zachary. <br/> building things at patlytics.ai

As a recent graduate from Monash, here are some interesting projects I have worked on, including the implementation of [FlameDB](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16C1C8r9Ajc643wo3UkWVRltPIiJUz49p/view?usp=drive_link), [a next-gen video annotation system](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SqZ1HeCXPcry34NxDlm2OJKbznOw_LE8/view?usp=sharing), and [a review management system for Monash](https://zachkhong.vercel.app/project/ureview-monash)

You can find out more about me through the things I write about and the projects I have done. Feel free to reach out to me on my social media accounts too.
