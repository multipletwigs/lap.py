Hi! I am a designer and engineer currently residing in Malaysia, working for MoneyLion, a fintech startup. This page is more dedicated to experiments and design implementations that I learn from Vercel Engineers. You'll know who I'm talking about if you know me enough.

<br />

Ever since I was young, I never had a clear direction on what I want to do, but I know it will be design related. Coincidentally, coding made it possible for me to express myself through logic and design. I started coding in 2020, worked at [Estee Lauder](somethign) for my internship and now trying to make my way through adulthood. I gather my thoughts and journals about life here.

<br />

You can find out more about me through the things I write about and the projects I have done. Feel free to reach out to me on my social media accounts too.
