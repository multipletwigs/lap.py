# hi there, i'm zachary. <br/>  building things at patlytics.ai

Hi! I am a designer and engineer currently residing in Malaysia, used to work for [MoneyLion](https://www.moneylion.com/), a fintech startup. Currently on a short break before I move on to pursue my DevOps career at a local quant firm (big leap I know, but it's what I want). This page is more dedicated to experiments and design implementations that I learn from [Vercel Engineers](https://front-alias.vercel.app/about#team). You'll know who I'm talking about if you know me enough.

<br />

Ever since I was young, I never had a clear direction on what I want to do, but I know it will be design related. Coincidentally, coding made it possible for me to express myself through logic and design. I started coding in 2020, worked at [Estee Lauder](https://www.elcompanies.com/en/news-and-media/newsroom/company-features/2021/elc-expand-its-technology) for my internship and now trying to make my way through adulthood. I gather my thoughts and journals about life here.

<br />

As a recent graduate from Monash, here are some interesting projects I have worked on, including the implementation of [FlameDB](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16C1C8r9Ajc643wo3UkWVRltPIiJUz49p/view?usp=drive_link), [a next-gen video annotation system](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SqZ1HeCXPcry34NxDlm2OJKbznOw_LE8/view?usp=sharing), and [a review management system for Monash](https://zachkhong.vercel.app/project/ureview-monash)

<br />

You can find out more about me through the things I write about and the projects I have done. Feel free to reach out to me on my social media accounts too.
