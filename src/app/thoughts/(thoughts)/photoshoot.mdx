# A photoshoot for myself

I could never really pinpoint what I felt about myself. Early this year, I had a rather unpleasant experience involving several life-changing events that left me feeling lost. But I wanted to commemorate this moment in my life, where I felt liberated from all my responsibilities and expectations all because I went on an impromptu photoshoot with a stranger.

> I started to notice things I never did before. Well, I mean I did see them, just never paid attention to them. For some reason, everything has became a metaphor.
