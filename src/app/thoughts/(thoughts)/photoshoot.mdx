# A photoshoot for myself

I could never really pinpoint what I felt about myself. Early this year, I had a rather unpleasant experience involving several life-changing events that left me feeling lost. But I wanted to commemorate this moment in my life, where I felt liberated from all my responsibilities and expectations all because I went on an impromptu photoshoot with a stranger.

<br />

> I started to notice things I never did before. Well, I mean I did see them, just never paid attention to them. For some reason, everything has became a metaphor.

The photoshoot was done at [Bukit Antarabanga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bukit_Antarabangsa), my childhood home. A [landslide](https://ms.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanah_runtuh_Bukit_Antarabangsa_2008) happened there back when I was 10 and I had to evacuate through a path dug out by rescuers at the time with my family. It was a surreal experience to be back here, especially after seeing everything nearly destroyed. The government did rebuild the place into a beautiful park, after nearly 10 more years of hard work!\

Something clicked when I was there, made me feel like even during the worst moments of my life, we can always rebuild and make something beautiful out of it.

Shoutout to the stranger, [sj](https://www.instagram.com/2youn8/) , who eventually became one of my closest friends ever! Not sure if you'll see this (yes i secretly edited it again after showing you) but I'm really glad I met you!
