# A story about anything

What stood out to me for this movie is that decisions are often times irrational. You could spend your whole life searching for a purpose, not knowing why you're so unsure of something and wake up one day suddenly knowing, yes, this is what I want. What has drawn me to watch this movie in the first place was the iconic scene of Tom and Summer in the elevator, with *The Smiths* playing in the background. I just had to know how their relationship developed from there.
<br/>
I think what broke my heart a little was the IKEA scene where Summer told Tom... *"You're okay with keeping this casual...right?"* and Tom has no other option but to nod to it. *DING DING DING* you got yourself a situationship! However, in the defense of Summer, sometimes if you don't know what you want, and don't believe in something, it's hard to provide any promises, and there's no reason to in the first place.
<br/>
> "You don't want to be named as anybody's girlfriend, and now you're someone's wife?", Tom asked, and Summer replied, "I just woke up one day and I knew."
<br/>
This scene was too nicely written, where both of Summer and Tom's beliefs swapped. They both influenced each other in a way that they never thought possible, and isn't this what we all are? A collection of experiences and beliefs that we've picked up along the way? Summer never believed in fate, and Tom never believed in mere coincidences. But in the end, they both found themselves in a place where they never thought they'd be.
<br/>
>"If Tom had learned anything... it was that you can't ascribe great cosmic significance to a simple earthly event. Coincidence, that's all anything ever is, nothing more than coincidence... Tom had finally learned, there are no miracles. There's no such thing as fate, nothing is meant to be. He knew, he was sure of it now.", said the narrator.
<br/>
The way I see it, this scene could be applied to anything at all. You can spend your whole life thinking about your dream job, and suddenly wake up and find yourself knowing exactly what you want. We all are influenced by every little thing that happens to us, and *click* one day, we just know.
<br/>
There's no explanation to a lot of things, and that's okay. We just have to believe that one day, we'll wake up and know.
<br/>
Rating 7/10 movie, would recommend to watch it at least once in your life.
