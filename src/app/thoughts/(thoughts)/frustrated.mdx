# I'm Frustrated~Sunday, 10 March 2024 - 1:39PM

I think I lost it today when I dropped my film camera on the floor, having the film roll out and exposed to light. Now all the good photos are wasted. I was already off to a bad start when I was late for my guitar class plus receiving weird news about something else. I can't help but wonder if I'm the one that's overthinking things and complicating my own life.

<br/>

Maybe it was because I also missed breakfast and was dehydrated. At least the coffee shop I decided to go to was calming. I was able to sit down and write something. Someone told me, **Lappy, I think you should think less and do more.** and I always envy people who can do this naturally. How do you not think about stuff!

<br/>

I have tendency to get frustrated when I don't make progress, or I am stuck at the same place for too long. Before publishing this page, I actually had more to write, but after taking a nice walk and asking myself if I'm overreacting, I think eventually I realised that I'm just blowing things out of proportions.

<br/>

I hope next week will be better though.
