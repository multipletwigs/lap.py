# 第 N 個開始

Wow! Another site?! Yes, this is going to be different. I swear. I finally made an effort to make sure that new entries for blogs are easily configurable, plus I can actually extend from the application to add new features. I realized that there are too many flaws with my [old site](https://zachkhong.info). I had to manually remember what to configure on Notion to publish a post. Now, this is different, because my site can also be used to experiment with new code and designs I find interesting.

<br />
With server components, I can use `~import fs from "fs"` that lets me read my `~.mdx`
files locally, on the server. Previously with `~notion-api`, I had to make several
api calls to get the metadata of the file I need, with custom page fields and a bunch
of database key configurations that made it difficult for my pea brain to keep track.

<br />
Since files are technically created on the server, the metadata that exist for that
file is exactly what I need. The `~readSync` function helps me get just enough metadata,
such as `~cdate`.

<br />

**However, what is this for really?**

<br />I think this is just a place for me to ramble on my ambitions and dreams. My experiences mostly
manifests itself in my [mem.ai](https://mem.ai) notebook. I want to gather
everything from there and place it somewhere nice on the internet.{" "}

我覺得是時候睡了， 晚安喔，起身了再寫吧 ～
