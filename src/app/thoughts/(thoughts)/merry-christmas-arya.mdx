# 🎄 MERRY CHRISTMAS ARYA! 

> 🎺 Jingle bell! Jingle bell! Jingle bell rock! Jingle bell swing and jingle bells ring! Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun! Now the jingle hop has begun!

<br/>

Well well well, looks like I'm your secret santa this time of the year! Right after your graduation party too 😂 HAHAH ~ So I've been to your apartment, and I was like it would probably be really really cool if you had a bunch of plants around. Soooooo for this Christmas, I got you a plant! 🌱 

<br/> 

You know it's really not just ANY plant ~ It's a plant that I potted myself! 🌱🌱🌱 I know you're probably thinking, "What? You potted a plant yourself?!" Well, I did! And I'm really proud of it! 😂😂😂 The problem is I can't just give the whole plant to you and I have to re-pot them :( so it will take around another week or monitoring before the plant is ready to be given to you.

<br/>

Now... you can redeem **ONE FREE COUPON** from me! 🎁🎁🎁 By choosing one of any plants below! Let me know which one you'd want!! And you'll receive it next Wednesday!
