# Why I failed at building blogs

People often underestimate what they want when building a blog. Text-only? Nah, maybe you will want a Vote System? Images? View Count? Filtering? The scope will keep creeping... and now your initial thought of just writing something on the web is muddled with growing complexities.

<br />
This usually happens to me after I made my init repo, and pushed my first
`~chore: init`. A post push clarity hits me and would have me asking "Why does
it feel like I have so much to do?" Extensibility becomes your obsession because
that is what academia trains you to do. _Looking at you [FIT2099, Object
Oriented Programming](https://handbook.monash.edu/2024/units/FIT2099?year=2024)_

<br />
Boom, first scope creep. Making it easy for you to add blogs. You solve one
problem, more pop up. Metadata, categories, sorting, drafts, last edited,
creation date, edited by, maybe [JSX Showcase](https://mdxjs.com/)? - it never
ends. Hours in, you're burnt out, wondering, "Do I even need this shit?"
<br />
But your ego won't quit. "Just need a database for votes, comments, view
count... OH WAIT, SCROLLING ANIMATIONS!" Suddenly, your simple blog is a
Frankenstein's monster of web dev.
<br />
Just as you're about to rage-quit to Medium, epiphany strikes: "Holy shit... am
I even building this to write?"
<br />
Plot twist! This was never about blogging. It's about flexing your l33t coding
skillz. That over-engineered mess? It's a neon sign screaming "LOOK HOW AWESOME
I AM!"
<br />
So, pick a lane:
<br />
1. Wanna write? Close the IDE, subscribe to bear blog, and type away. <br /> 2.
Wanna code? Embrace the over-engineering. Call it a portfolio piece.
<br />
I will just stop pretending it's both. No one cares about my Zustand store if
all it holds is "Hello World" and empty promises.
<br />
Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to implement blockchain comments. You know, for
extensibility.
