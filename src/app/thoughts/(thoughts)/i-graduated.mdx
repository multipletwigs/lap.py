# Graduation kinda hurts.

I hated how I sped run through university. What was I supposed to do though? I was in Year 1 when COVID-19 hit. What was I supposed to do? I couldn't go anywhere, all the people I loved during that time were all game addicts. It's only natural that I went to university... _right?_

<br />

Taking software also means I was permanently glued to my devices. Mind you, I grew up in a typical asian household where all that matters during that time was how well I did academically, that was where all my value was. I was constantly stressed and anxious, I literally couldn't enjoy anything at all (or at least know how to enjoy it).

<br />

I graduated 3 months ago (at the time of writing), on **10th of July 2023**. It was also the day I started my first job + got the results for my final semester. I left work early on the first day, and broke down in the parking lot. This graduation hurt. All this time, I was so focused on studies and my own success, I negleted my own wellbeing.

<br />

I know I could make it, but was it really worth the effort? During that time, I was dealing with major shifts in my life, my mother's cancer, plus a bunch of relationship issues with friends in general. My coping mechanism for the whole ordeal was to just... let go and not participate.

<br />

> I did the bare minimum for everything. I feel pathetic, helpless. I wish I didn't exist.

<br />

Why do I keep putting myself in these situations? Why do I keep meeting horrible people that I try so hard to please? Well, I guess a relevation was made after struggling for so long. I was too comfortable at where I was? Hanging out with the same 5 people, studying the same thing and doing the same routine everyday gave me certainty. Surely, it worked at the beginning, where it gave me assurance that the same 5 people, will always bring me happiness.

<br />

I never liked competitive games in the first place and I never liked Overwatch. But I thought I liked them because everyone around me liked them. Being too comfortable at what was pretty toxic in the first place.

<br />

_Whoops! Is this too long? I think I'll continue writing tomorrow._
