# Graduation kinda hurts.

I despised the breakneck pace at which I rushed through my university experience. Yet, what choice did I really have? The world was thrust into the tumultuous grip of the infamous [COVID-19](https://www.who.int/health-topics/coronavirus) during my first year, leaving me confined and isolated. The cherished companions of that period were all immersed in the [realm of gaming](https://playvalorant.com/en-us/). Was it, then, inevitable that I _sought solace_ in the sanctuary of academia?

<br />

Pursuing a course in software further cemented my attachment to electronic devices. It's worth noting that my upbringing, steeped in the traditions of a typical Asian household, placed paramount importance on academic achievements as the sole metric of personal worth. As a result, I found myself in a perpetual state of stress and anxiety, rendering me incapable of deriving any semblance of enjoyment from life's pursuits, or even understanding how to do so.

<br />

I completed my academic journey just three months ago, on the memorable **10th of July 2023**. It was a day that held both the commencement of my first professional endeavor and the revelation of my final semester results. To my surprise, on that initial day at my new job, I found myself leaving work prematurely, seeking solace in the solitude of the parking lot where emotions overwhelmed me, and I broke down. This particular graduation was bittersweet; throughout my educational pursuit, I had maintained an unwavering focus on academic success, inadvertently neglecting my own well-being in the process.

<br />

I possessed the conviction that I could achieve my academic goals, but in retrospect, I question whether the exhaustive effort was truly worth it. Those years were marked by significant upheavals in my life, including my mother's battle with cancer and a myriad of interpersonal challenges with friends and acquaintances. My coping mechanism during that tumultuous period was a deliberate withdrawal from active participation—a strategy akin to what's colloquially referred to as ["躺平"](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-my/%E8%BA%BA%E5%B9%B3) or "lying flat," where I simply let go of the relentless pursuit and chose a path of passive detachment.

<br />

Indeed, it proved effective! During my final semester, my sole focus was on cultivating happiness and remaining unfazed by external pressures. It was, in essence, a much-needed respite from the relentless weight of my own expectations. I actively ventured out to seek enjoyable experiences, and serendipitously, I encountered an extraordinary group of individuals who have since become my closest friends. Through their support and camaraderie, I embarked on a journey of self-discovery and personal growth that has enriched my life in countless ways.

<br />

This graduation stung, in part, because I wished I had pursued these enriching experiences earlier, during the formative years of my university journey. At times, I find myself grappling with regrets for my passive approach and my neglect of my own mental well-being. I had reached a point of burnout and exhaustion that weighed heavily on me. Indeed, the past is behind me now, and I'm on a continuous journey of self-discovery. I would venture to say that life, at this moment, is rather promising and enjoyable.

<br />

_But yeah, this is why graduation sucked for me. But i'm glad everything happened, nonetheless._
