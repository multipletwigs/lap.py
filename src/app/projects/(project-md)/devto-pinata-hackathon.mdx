_I won [first place](https://dev.to/devteam/congrats-to-the-pinata-challenge-winners-5d2e) ðŸ¥‡ - Thank you to [The DEV Team](https://dev.to/devteam) for all the kind words, and of course, thank you to all my friends who voted for me :) Anyways, I'm quite satisfied with the prizes for this one! Check out [my submission](https://dev.to/nightlyinks/pinata-og-generate-beautiful-opengraph-images-with-pinata-file-api-2mmp) here! and at [pinata.nightly.ink](https://pinata.nightly.ink) for the live site :>_

## ðŸ‘¹ I HATE MAKING OG IMAGES!!!

No, you don't get it, I really do. I could make one in Figma, but my graphic design skills are horrible. Vercel recommends OG Image generation with Satori, which is really handy but I just can't make one that I like! I always wanted to make a simple and easy to use OG Image generator where I just plop in the `~og:image` URL in the metatag and BOOM! Site preview served.

<br />
Pinata's File API to me was intriguing, I guess it is Google Drive, but with
their Gateway API, it made getting files super accessible. Plus, there's really
always only going to be one CID for every file, it made it super easy for my
idea to come true because I don't have to think much about relations. I even
dogfood my own hackathon project for my site submission because of how simple it
is to use!
<br />

## Afterthoughts...

This is the first time I have participated in a public hackathon, but it definitely would not be my last! I have been joining hackathons since I started university in 2019, and you can see a very clear progression on the way... from overengineered sites and ideas, to just plain simple execution. I am going to turn this into my own SaaS though... check again in a few months!

Till next time reader!
