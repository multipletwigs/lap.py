It was my final semester, I was itching to join a hackathon to mark one final win before I graduated. I realised that over the years, I've acquired substantial amount of technical knowledge in building web products and joining a hackathon would make solid proof that I can build! It was job hunting season too so an extra win is an extra chance to get hired.
