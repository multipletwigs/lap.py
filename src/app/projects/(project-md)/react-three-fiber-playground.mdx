# Experimenting with React Fibre

When I was working on my portfolio, I stumbled upon a neat looking [site](https://ui.gallery/) through some blogs called _The User Interface Gallery_. What caught my attention was a component called **Kinetic Carousel**, which features a series of nicely crafted gradient strips that move in a wave-like fashion, responding to the user's mouse movement.

<br />

At first, I thought the component was made with pure CSS, JS and HTML, but after inspecting the source code, I found out that it was made with a library called [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber/getting-started/introduction). Which made more sense on how the component was able to achieve such a smooth animation.

<br />

Since I had a few photoshoots throughout the year, I wanted to create a similar component to showcase my photos. So this entry will highlight my journey of learning how to use React Three Fiber and how I was able to create a similar component to the one I saw on _The User Interface Gallery_.

## Getting Started

Obviously, the first step was to go through the documentation, but I soon was able to find a [neat reference](https://codesandbox.io/s/l4klb?file=/src/App.js) to what I sort of what to achieve. Using convenient plugins like `~@react/three/drei`, create a small rotating box that utilizes the `~Three.js` frame-loop.

<IntroScene1 />

Following the simple implementation where we rotate both the `~Edge` and `~Box` components, following the `~useFrame()` gameloop tick, and adding to the rotation through a `~ref`. Here `~Edge` also takes in an offset so it rotates faster than the `~Box` for a cool effect.

```ts
const RotatingBox = () => {
  const boxRef = useRef<BoxGeometry>(null);
  const edgeRef = useRef<any>(null);

  const rotateBox = (delta: number) => {
    if (boxRef) {
      boxRef.current?.rotateX(delta);
      boxRef.current?.rotateY(delta);
    }
  };

  const rotateEdge = (delta: number, offset?: number) => {
    if (edgeRef) {
      edgeRef.current?.rotateX(delta + (offset || 0));
      edgeRef.current?.rotateY(delta + (offset || 0));
    }
  };

  useFrame((_, delta) => {
    rotateBox(delta);
    rotateEdge(delta, 0.02);
  });

  return (
    <mesh rotation={[Math.PI / 4, Math.PI / 4, 0]}>
      <meshStandardMaterial color="dark purple" />
      <boxGeometry args={[2, 2, 2]} ref={boxRef} />
      <Edges ref={edgeRef} color={"white"} />
    </mesh>
  );
};
```
