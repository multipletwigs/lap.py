_We won third place! But this was like 3 years ago so I lost the announcement
link :) Anyways, thank you to
[Hajullah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hajullahputra) and [Jian
Hui](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lee-jian-hui-1708281ba) for joining this with
me! Here's our [github repo](https://github.com/multipletwigs/hack2hire), but
the live site has been down since the db behind it is no longer active!_

## It's honestly just a CMS

Hm, I guess the prompt was really just about developing an events management system. Not much creativity was put into it, though I remember I did spend a lot of time trying to design the schema that fits our problem statement. That was really a waste of time. It was just a 2 day hackathon anyways? Plus we made it too complex to implement...

<br />

Although we did win, I'm not particularly proud of this one. I overengineered a lot of stuff, the app even crashed during the demo, but one thing that I did do right was make my app look really good compared to all the other contestants. If you think that aesthetics don't matter in a competition, you're REALLY wrong. They matter more than anything.

## Afterthoughts...

I remember using Prisma, and Supabase, but now I think about how I was probably influenced by a lot of YT Tech Influencers... I don't see why I would have needed it when SQL would have done the same job, simpler and better. However, this experience certainly did pave way for me to think about using the least amount of complexity to achieve something better, which is how I probably won all the other hackathons anyways!

## Prizes!

1. Dell SWE 1 Offer Letter (i rejected it tho... lowkey lowballin)
2. Some cash!?!?!?! I think RM200
3. Some merch and certs
