# Gradient Cards

Hi. This kinda sucks TT. But you can test it out by uploading a photo and seeing the gradient change. I need to do so many improvements to my site to make sure I render stuff properly. If not there's too many custom code. Tech debt is real!

<br />

Now this kinda works ok-ish if the colours in the photo uploaded are rich enough.
