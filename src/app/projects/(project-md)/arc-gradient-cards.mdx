# Gradient Cards

Experiment number 1! IMO, this doesn't look TOO bad for a 2 hr prototype! What intrigued me was how the [User Interface Gallery](https://ui.gallery/) was able to create [dynamic cards](https://ui.gallery/#dynamic-cards). I was absolutely fascinated by the motion and soft colours!\
\
Hmm...Maybe I could recreate it? Well... yes and no ahah ~ here's a quick demo of what I managed to create.

<ArcGradientCard />

As highlighted in the blog, the trick is to use blurs and blend mix mode, and a quick inspection of the source code inspection tool reveals that two of the same images where positioned in an `~absolute` container, with a `~linear-gradient` background. The `~mix-blend-mode` was set to `~screen` to create the soft overlay effect. Add in a little differently timed `~transform` and `~scale` and you get a nice blob gradient effect!

<br/>

Much experimentation is still needed to come up with the correct timing and angling of the gradient cards! Vercel designers are really on a different level to be able to think about design intuitively. I want to reach them someday. Till next time!\
